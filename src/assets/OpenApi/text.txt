Here's the JavaScript code to make responses more readable by formatting them into paragraphs:
 ```javascript
  function formatIntoParagraphs(text) { 
  // Split the text into sentences 
  const sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]+/g); 
  if (!sentences) {
   return text;
    // Return the original text if no sentences are detected 
    } 
    // Join sentences into paragraphs with two line breaks 
    const paragraphs = sentences.map((sentence, index) => { 
        if (index !== 0 && index % 3 === 0) 
        { // Assuming 3 sentences per paragraph 
    return '\n\n' + sentence.trim(); 
    } 
    return sentence.trim(); }).join(' '); 
    return paragraphs.trim(); } 
    // Example usage 
    const originalText = "This is a sample text. It contains multiple sentences. 
    They will be split into paragraphs. Here's another sentence for good measure. 
    And one more to ensure we have enough!"; 
    console.log(formatIntoParagraphs(originalText));

    
    ``` ### Explanation:
    1. **Sentence Detection**: 

    The function uses a regular expression to split the text into sentences. 
    This regex looks for sequences of characters not ending
    with `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by these punctuation marks.

    2. **Paragraph Formation**:
     It then iterates over these sentences,
    adding two line breaks every third sentence to create paragraphs. 
    This number can be adjusted for longer or shorter paragraphs.

    3. **Trim Whitespace**:
     The function trims any extra spaces from the
    sentences and at the end of the result to ensure clean output.

    4. **Edge Cases**: 
    If no sentences are detected (like in the case of very short text 
    or text without proper sentence ending punctuation), the original 
    text is returned. 
            
    This approach will format text into readable paragraphs, which should 
    enhance the user experience by breaking up long text into more
    digestible chunks. Remember, the paragraph 
    length (here, set to 3 sentences) can be customized based on 
    readability preferences or context.
